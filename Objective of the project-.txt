Objective of the project:-

Vrinda store wants to create an annual sales report for 2022. So that, they can understand their customers and grow more sales.

Questions solved:-
Compare the sales and order using single chart?
Which month got highest sales and orders?
Who purchased men or women in the year?
What are the different order status in the following year?
List top 5 states contributing to the sales? etc.

I had basically used google sheets to extract, clean , manipulate data to get meaningful insights. In the process I learnt many formulas/implementation of pivot table, charts, slicers etc.
